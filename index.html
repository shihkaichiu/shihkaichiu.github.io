      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>I am currently interested in manifolds with special holonomy
      and calibrated submanifolds. My main focus is on Calabi-Yau
      manifolds and special Lagrangian submanifolds.</p>

            ABSTRACT. We prove that on a complete Calabi-Yau manifold \(M\)
            with Euclidean volume growth, a harmonic function with
            subquadratic polynomial growth is the real part of a holomorphic
            function. This generalizes a result of Conlon-Hein. We prove
            this result by proving a Liouville type theorem for harmonic
            \(1\)-forms, which follows from a new local \(L^2\) estimate of
            the differential. We also give another proof based on the
            construction of harmonic functions with polynomial growth in
            Ding, and the algebraicity of tangent cones in Liu-Székelyhidi.

          none">ABSTRACT. We study complete noncompact Calabi-Yau
          manifolds with maximal volume growth. These manifolds arise
          as desingularizations of affine Calabi-Yau varieties, and as
          bubbles in the singularity formation of compact
          Kähler-Einstein manifolds. The rather explicit metric
          behavior of these manifolds enables us to understand the
          metric behavior of the seemingly impenetrable compact
          case. It is therefore of great importance to study the
          uniqueness/deformation problem of these manifolds and
          metrics. Our first result is that subquadratic harmonic
          functions on such manifolds must be pluriharmonic. This
          should be seen as the linear version of the
          uniqueness/deformation problem. Next, we show that if a
          \(\partial\bar\partial\)-exact Calabi-Yau manifold with
          maximal volume growth has tangent cone at infinity which
          splits an Euclidean factor, then the metric is unique under
          subquadratic perturbation of the Kähler
          potential. Geometrically, this means that the Calabi-Yau
          metric is rigid under deformations that fix the tangent cone
          at infinity. It is therefore interesting to know if a
          quadratic perturbation of the Kähler potential, which should
          correspond to an automorphism of the tangent cone at
          infinity, really changes the metric. As a first step toward
          understanding this picture, we construct new Calabi-Yau
          metrics on \(\mathbf{C}^3\) with tangent cone at infinity
          given by \(\mathbf{C} \times A_2\), and we show that these
          metrics are inequivalent in the sense that they are not
          related by isometries and scalings. This existence result
          provides the first example of families of Calabi-Yau metrics
          with the same tangent cone at infinity while the underlying
          complex structure is fixed.</div></li>
